# Method


In Ayan, I used a dataset containing employee information
<br> including :
* name 
* employee ID
<br>

And I added real-time
* date  
* time data 

<br>

We then trained an AI to analyze this data, deriving productivity.
<br>
* absence 
* reasons 
* delays 
* Over Time in Cafeteria 
* Outside Work hours 

<br>

for each employee. The AI was tailored to assess these factors based on specific criteria and time context.
 After training, I integrated the AI into a predefined logic. Testing involved user-bot interaction to ensure functionality.
